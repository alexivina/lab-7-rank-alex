Hi this is Alex and I created this awesome repo for you to admire.

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
kermit <- read_csv("kermit.csv")

kermit_hist <- ggplot(kermit, aes(x = Score.pre)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~ Gender)

kermit_hist

```

Creator: doing rank-based tests

```{r}

# Is there a significant difference in pre-talk Kermit scores for males and females?

# Unpaired: Mann-Whitney U

mwu_kermit <- kermit %>% 
  wilcox.test(Score.pre ~ Gender, data = .)

mwu_kermit


```
